"""Inversion Count (large)
Problem ID: invcountlarge
Your task is to count the number of inversions in a list of integers. An inversion is a pair of indices (i, j) such that
i < j and A[i] > A[j].
Input
The first line of input contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 200 000), the number of integers in the list. Note that N
is provided for test case readability and your program does not need to use it. The second line contains N integers
A1, A2, . . . , AN (1 ≤ Ai ≤ 200 000).
Output
Display the number of inversions in the list.
